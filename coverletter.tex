\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
As an one-year incoming exchange student at Politecnico di Milano, I’m delighted to submit my
application for this opportunity from LinkedIn. As a graduate student of computer science from
National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU) in Taiwan, I’m confident that my knowledge of
system software, experience in frontend and backend coding, activities on open source projects,
and precise attention to detail would make me an asset to the team at Bending Spoons.

\lettersection{Why Bending Spoons?}

Bending Spoons is one of the world's leading mobile developing companies, which is a good place to
practice my skills as a software engineering intern. I believe that I can meet many wonderful
developers that can make innovations together, which is very cool. In addition, I believe as a 
start-up company, I can have more flexibility to contribute to the company, which I wish I can
do something out-of-box and make contributions here.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I had worked in four companies as a software engineering intern before, I have strong experiences
to work efficiently, such as how to utilize version control tools and issue tracking systems to
develop with other people, how to communicate with co-workers and managers. I also joined many
open source projects before, for example, I contributed more than 50 commits for the Servo browser,
an experimental browser of Mozilla. My master research topic is about JavaScript parallelism,
in which I learn a lot of knowledge in system software, and not to mention the knowledge of
computer science that I learn from NYCU. I believe these experiences would be helpful for doing
well on this job.
