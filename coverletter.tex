% \lettersection{About Me}


Upon reading the listing for a ``Performance Engineer'' role with Cerabras,
I knew I had a strong interest in this opportunity.
Cerebras, as an emerging start-up company focusing on developing AI systems,
had a mission of creating the biggest AI chip in the world, which is attractive to me.
Between my education and work experience, I'm positive that I'll be a strong addition to the team.
During three-year master academic training that focuses on system software,
I have researched about ``parallel web applications,''
which I studied and analyzed the performance of offloading parallel JavaScript programs by
building an offloading system and also setting up a parallel JavaScript benchmark for evaluation.
Also, inspired by the course, accelerator architectures for machine learning, in NYCU,
I learned the concept of designing accelerators for AI,
read many papers about accelerators for AI,
and even cultivated my interests in AI hardware.
I am interested extensively in the technologies included in the listing, such as parallel programming, high-performance computing, or GPGPU computing.
I also demonstrate my cooperation and communication skills with others by contributing many open-source projects
and having experience of being an intern in four companies in the past.
I am eager to apply these skills to support Cerabras in the listed ``Performance Engineer'' role,
and I'd be thrilled to discuss my qualifications more in person.
I have also attached my full resume detailing my experience and achievements for your review.
Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your reply.
