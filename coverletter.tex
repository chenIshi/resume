\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
As an one-year exchange student at Politecnico di Milano, I’m delighted to submit my
application for the opportunity of "graduate program for engineering students".
As a graduate student of computer science from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU) in Taiwan,
I’m confident that my knowledge of system software, experience in frontend and backend coding, activities on open source projects,
and precise attention to detail in system and software would make me an asset to the team at Bending Spoons.

\lettersection{Why Bending Spoons?}

Bending Spoons is one of the world's leading mobile developing companies, which is a good place to
practice my skills as a software engineering intern. I believe that I can meet many wonderful
developers that can make creations together, which is very cool and exciting.
In addition, I believe as a young age company, I can have more flexibility to contribute to the company,
which I wish I can do something out-of-box and make contributions here.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I had worked in four companies as a software engineering intern before in Taiwan, I have strong experiences
to work efficiently, such as debugging, performance analysis, communication for developing or coding style.
I am active on open source, in which I contributed more than a hundred projects on Github and cooperated with
developers all over the world.
My master research topic is about JavaScript parallelism,
in which I learn a lot of knowledge in system software, and not to mention the knowledge of
computer science that I learn from NYCU and Polimi. I believe these experiences would help me do well in this job.
Last but not least, as an international student, I can give Bending Spoons more cultural diversity and create
more innovations.
